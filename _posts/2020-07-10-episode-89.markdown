Next up is [**Дрыгва**](https://drygva.bandcamp.com/) (wrtitten Drygva in english), a pagan/folk/death metal band from Belarus, with another new release from this year, Брацтва (means "brotherhood") off **Вайдэлот**.

[**Drops of Heart**](https://dropsofheart.bandcamp.com/) does a melodic death metal version of a traditional Russian folk metal song, Oy, Moroz, Moroz. Next up, two "mashup" tracks, starting with [**Aura**](https://aurapower.bandcamp.com/) from Moscow mixing a Russian military song with Children of Bodom's "Downfall"!

[**Свентояр**](https://aurapower.bandcamp.com/) ("Sventoyar" in english) from Ukraine with a track called Goatsbusters (no, not "Ghostbusters").
